// This begins the section specific to this document
= Activities
Grayson Robotics is an organization for teaching high school students how to build and operate large (150 lbs), semi-autonomous, mobile robots.
We conduct our operations, communications, fundraising, and engineering activities to accomplish this.
Participation in the FIRST Robotics Competition (see: @frc) serves as the primary reason for building robots.
Additionally, other projects that require similar engineering and manufacturing capabilities may also inform the organizations structure.

== FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) <frc>
The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) challenges teams of young people and their mentors to solve a common problem using a standard "kit of parts" and a common set of rules. Teams build robots from both the kit and the parts they design themselves. The official FRC season starts with event registration in the fall, proceeds from the Kickoff in early January through the primary robot design and build period in February. District qualifying events occur from late February through early April, followed by the state championship, and culminating at the FIRST World Championship events.

= Goals <goals>
Grayson Robotics has established the following goals:

+ Provide a practical engineering education.
+ Interdisciplinary approach to engineering that prevents miscommunication between engineering departments.
+ Demonstrate comprehensive quality control in all engineering and manufacturing activities.
	+ Implement a Quality Management System as outlined by ISO 9001:2015.

== Goals specific to FRC
+ Compete in an official FRC season without losing a single match.
+ Operate the most reliable robot at any event we attend.
+ Maintain the most comprehensive knowledge base and documentation of any other FRC team.

== Educational strategy
Mentors do not treat students like subordinates.
A mentor shall not teach a student something in a way they wouldnâ€™t teach another mentor.
Team members shall divide tasks between students and mentors such that students gain the most new knowledge from the tasks they complete.
In the absence a specific safety concern, students have the first choice for what they work on.
Mentors support this by providing students with the instruction necessary to complete their tasks and completing other tasks where necessary.

Instruction should not rely on rote memorization.
Instructors should focus on teaching students how to find and document correct information for future use.
Departments - as defined in @departments - may use tests to assess a members ability to recall information needed when using a reference is impractical.
For example: operating a robot in a competition match or making a repair between matches, where there's no time to reference a document.

= Organizing strategy
This section explains how Grayson Robotics divides work between team members and uses documents to manage that work.
Team members shall organize all work as the responsibility of one or more departments listed in @departments.
Team members shall document all work via Action Items, as shown in @action_items or Projects as shown in @projects.  

== Departments <departments>
Grayson Robotics has organized itself into departments;
Subsets of team members who contribute to a specific category of team activities.
Membership is not static and one member can participate with several departments.

Departments are not organized into a command hierarchy. Rather, departments agree on
responsibilities to each other ahead of undertaking any interdisciplinary tasks or action items. 

Grayson Robotics treats all conflicts between departments as process failures.
For example, if Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering have a design conflict they - and the Systems Engineering Dept. - must resolve it by re-working the
engineering processes or design specification such that the designers have a better understanding of what they need to do. 

Put another way, the team resolves design or scheduling conflicts by interrogating and re-working our processes.

Departments must not impede each other outside of the scope of their work.

Grayson Robotics consists of 12 permanent departments:
- Strategy
- Intelligence
- Operations
- Safety
- Information Technology
- Manufacturing Engineering
- Outreach
- Marketing
- Systems Engineering

== Projects <projects>
Projects organize non-standard or non-recurring work, and coordinate major efforts between departments.
Team members shall use the project process where:
- they require a budget, scare resources, or a requisition of supplies
- they expect work to go on for more than one week
- different departments need to coordinate

Otherwise, the Action Item process described in @action_items may be more appropriate.

=== Project process goals
This process intends to:
- help team members avoid unnecessary tasks
- help team members compose a budget
- help team members identify and organize non-recurring tasks
- create a priority ranking system between different project types

=== Project process
Projects progress through three stages:
1. Draft
2. Open
3. Closed

To start a project, at least one team member shall propose the project by presenting a
draft project document to other team members.

Project documents shall begin with a statement of how it helps implement the team strategy or FRC season strategy.

The members proposing the project shall seek approval from all members expected to help complete the project,
and members expected to use anything created with the project.

Additionally, depending on the required resources, the proposal authors shall seek approval from these groups:

- if requesting funding, the department managing the requisite budget must approve
- if requesting computing resources, IT must approve
- if requesting shop-tools, parts, or work space, operations must approve

Once the project authors obtain all approvals, they shall change the project status to Open and
use the requested resources to complete the project.

If a team member wishes to change the project goals, objectives, or resource allocation
they must obtain approval from all team members who the change would affect.

Once team members realized all project goals, the project authors shall change its status to Closed.

To close a project before realizing all goals, all members working to complete the project
must agree to do so.

=== Project types
This standard recognizes the following project types:
- Safety CAR Project
	- projects resolving a safety related Corrective Action Report
- Safety Project
	- projects intended to rectify a potential safety issue that hasn't yet lead to an incident
- Standards Project
	- projects that would update an organization-wide standard
- Robot CAR Project
	- projects resolving a CAR related to and FRC robot project
- FRC Robot Project
	- The FRC robot project for the current competition season
- CAR Project
	- projects resolving all other types of CAR
- General Project
	- any other projects

==== Ranking projects
Project ranking shows team members what work should proceed where working on one project
conflicts with work on another project such that only one may progress at the same time.

By default, project types have the following rank. From most to least important:

1. Safety CAR
2. Safety 
3. Standards
4. Robot CAR
5. FRC Robot
6. CAR
7. General

Safety CAR projects shall take precedence over tasks connected to any other project type.

Where conflicts arise between Safety CAR projects,
the team shall prioritize the CAR for the incident most likely to reoccur sooner.

Safety projects shall take precedence over all non-safety projects.

For projects not related to Safety or Safety CARs:
a project shall take precedence over other projects of a lower rank, unless a team member initiates the process for waiving project in @waiving_project_rank.

==== Waiving project rank <waiving_project_rank>
This process shall not apply to Safety, or Safety CAR, projects.

When tasks connected to non-safety projects of different rank require the same resources, team members may give precedence to the task of lower rank if all members who approved the relevant projects agree.


== Action Items <action_items>
Team members start an Action Item when they find a problem they wish to solve that doesn't require a project or resources allocated for a specific use.
The purpose of the Action Item process it to ensure that team members document and communicate all efforts to other team members.

The Action Item process is only appropriate for tasks that team members can complete within a week. 
Team members shall use the Action Item process when:
- the tasks involved require more than one person
- the tasks interfere with other work and require coordination with the rest of the team

=== Action Item process
Using the team Band for communications:
+ Discus action item to determine relevant departments.
+ Authors create a list of tasks and delegate as appropriate.
+ Set a deadline to either finish, abandon, or promote the action item to a full project.
+ Notify all members of relevant departments.
+ Obtain the ascent of everyone expected to do work to complete any projects or tasks.
+ Author shall document the completion of the action item after team members complete all tasks.

If the action item requires time greater than the original deadline set, and or allocation of funds, the authors shall turn it into a project.

== Roles <roles>
A Role is a set of tasks and the resources made available to team members to complete them.
Grayson Robotics creates roles for projects or as part of a process defined by a standard.
This section defines all roles that the team must fulfill at all times or during the entire competition season.

=== Scouts <scouts>
Scouts gather qualitative and quantitative data about the capabilities and performance of other FRC teams' robots competing in the same events as Grayson Robotics.
The Strategy Dept. shall determine what data scouts collect.
The Intelligence Dept. shall select members to be scouts.
Scouts need not go to competition in person if gathering quantitative data on robot performance.

=== Pit Crew <pit_crew>
Members of the Pit Crew must attend competition and arrive promptly when the doors open unless otherwise stated by the schedule put forth by the Operations department. 

The Pit Crew are team members from different departments who perform maintenance on the robot between matches.

Each department determines which members may need to go to the pit on a per-competition basis.

The drive team are necessarily pit crew.
Each member of the Pit Crew is not necessarily needed in the pit at all times.
The Operations Dept. decides who needs to be present in the pit based on who they need to complete specific tasks.

=== Drive Team <drive_team>
The Operations Dept. shall form the drive team through the following process:
+ Members must pass an assessment of their basic ability to perform their respective role.
+ Members must prove their ability to perform their respective role without incurring penalties.
+ Final selection is random/by lottery.

The Strategy Dept. shall define the requirements for passing the exam.
The drive coach shall be a member of the Strategy Dept. unless no strategy Dept. members pass the assessment.

Drive team membership shall stay the same during an ongoing competition season unless:
- a member resigns
- a member requests to be leave due to an emergency
- a member violates the Code of Conduct as outlined in @code_of_conduct
- a member violates a safety rule defined in @safety or the Safety Manual (see: @safety_manual)
- a member is late to more than one (1) match

= Internal communications
== Personal email
Official communication and on-boarding as well as interacting with FIRST registration systems.
Sponsor communications.
Team members shouldn't use email for daily tasks.

== Git repositories
Controlled documentation, Project and Action Item documentation, and source code.

== File server
Other digital, especially non-text data, not covered by Git Repositories.

== Band
Meeting scheduling, calendar, and general communications. Use this for daily discussion.

= Meetings
Team members shall propose a meeting via a communications visible to all team members.
Typically, team members propose meetings via Band.
Team members' meeting proposal shall include the following information:
- Date, time, location, and other pertinent logistics.
- List any specific Projects they intend to work on.
- What departments or individuals they think should attend

Meetings require the approval of at least one mentor and anyone expected to complete work at the meeting.
The team member making the proposal shall add the meeting to the Band calendar after receiving approval.

== Safety briefing
Team members shall give a safety briefing for all persons who haven't visited the location before.
The briefing shall include the following: 
+ exit locations 
+ fire extinguisher locations 
+ fire evacuation plan & evacuation map locations 
+ fire alarm activation panel locations 
+ first aid kit locations 

+ Locations of other safety equipment if available. For example: eye wash station and emergency shower.

= Organizational Memory <om>
Documentation, namely building and maintaining an institutional knowledge base, is of the highest importance to Grayson Robotics.
This manual serves as the top-level document for Grayson Robotics. 

Organizational Memory (OM) is the sum total of accurate, recorded, and shared information that team members produce to aid in their work.

Requirements:
+ All other documentation shall be traceable to this manual.
+ Grayson Robotics shall establish a Document Control System (DCS) for all OM.
+ Grayson Robotics shall author all documentation in an open source and plain text format where the document type permits and the technology exists.
+ All documents shall adhere to the Concise Guide to APA Style, seventh Edition, ISBN: 978-1-4338-3273-4, sections 4 and 5.

Types of OM:
- Controlled Working Files
- Project Planing Documents
- Policies

The IT Dept. shall define procedures for managing OM, and requirements for document form, in: ORG-1 Document Control System (see: @org-1).

== Controlled Working Files
Controlled Working Files (CWF) are:
- any files used to define the form and function of an FRC robot other than the project document
- operating procedures for an FRC robot
- the source code used to control the robot or for processing scouting data
- CADD files used to build an FRC robot
- the brand standard and other marketing material
- any forms or standardized documents for communication with sponsors

== Project Planing Documents
Project Planning Documents (PPD) capture the Action Items process in @action_items or the Project process in @projects.

== Policies
Grayson Robotics Policies capture processes and techniques intended for repeated use over an indefinite period of time.
Team members shall author these documents only when the process is well known, and they expect it to be relevant for over a year.
Team members shall take care to create or deprecate policies only after careful reflection on the underlying process.

Grayson robotics recognizes three types of policy:
- Standards, including Organizational standards.
- Training manuals.
- Corrective Action Reports

=== Standards (SDR) <sdr>
Standards (SDR) define common processes and procedures for long-term use. 
Team members shall not standardize unnecessary or unsafe rules and processes.
The departments and team members that write or approve a standard must follow its processes.

SDRs shall adhere to the following:
- SDRs can be interdisciplinary and apply to multiple teams.
- Immediate safety concerns always take precedent over following SDRs.
- SDRs written by the Safety department always take precedent over other SDRs.
- SDRs supersede training documents in the event of a conflict.
- SDRs shall not conflict with each other.

Instead of defining a new SDR the document may simply reference external media (papers, books, videos, etc.),
or standards from outside organizations (ANSI, ISO, Georgia Tech, etc.). 
A copy of the referenced material shall be available to all team members.

=== Organizational Standards (ORG)
Organizational (ORG) standards are a kind of standard that applies to the entire team and all team members must approve and adhere to them.
ORGs, including this document, define the structure and functions of Grayson Robotics.

ORGs shall adhere to the following:
- ORGs necessarily apply to all departments.
- Immediate safety concerns always take precedent over following ORGs.
- ORGs supersede all documents of different types in the event of a conflict.
- ORGs may not conflict with each other.

=== Corrective Action Reports (CAR) <car>
Corrective Action Report (CAR) process helps team members trace, record, and correct flaws in designs, processes, or production, that have
significant and unexpected impact on safety, operations, or competitiveness.

Incidents that require the team to initiate the CAR process include:
+ Injury to a member of the team while acting on its behalf.
+ Injury to persons outside of the team resulting from actions of a member of the team, who is acting on its behalf.
+ Injury to any person caused by the teams equipment or at its facilities.
+ Unexpected failure of a robot in an official FRC playoff match.
+ Unexpected failure of equipment or tooling that delays the manufacturing or critical modification of an FRC robot.

In cases one through three, a team member shall initiate the CAR within twenty-four (24) hours of the incident.
In cases four or five, a team member shall initiate the CAR whenever it is most convenient but must be before the issue can re-occur unexpectedly.

==== CAR process
A CAR shall have one of two statuses;
- Open: once the author creates the document
- Closed: after team members complete all related work 

The steps of a CAR process are as follows:
+ Create a working document to track the CAR process.
+ Collect: Work with all involved parties to thoroughly document the incident.
+ Trace: Investigate the collected information and attempt to trace the root cause of the incident.
+ Take Action: Create a list of tasks to complete to eliminate the root cause. 
+ Progress Tracking: Document progress toward completing action items.
+ Close when all tasks are complete.

It is appropriate for team members to initiate a Project or Action item as described in: ORG-0 as needed to organize tasks.
In that case, the Project documents or Action Item Issues shall contain a reference to the CAR document name and number.

=== Training Manuals (TRM)
Training Manuals organize and preserve written instructions and other media that Grayson Robotics uses for reference, training, and teaching.
A training document may specify instructions for teaching or take the form of a tutorial regarding any subject applicable to the department the document is relevant to. 

Each TRM shall meet the following requirements:
+ Named and titled for the tool, technique, technology, or process it focuses on.
+ List any hazardous materials learners may encounter, required Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and any other known safety hazards.
+ List intended outcomes for learners.
+ Detail what the training covers and - at the discretion of the author - note similar topics the document will not cover.
+ All TRM shall begin with the following warranty and disclaimer:
"The authors, maintainers, and distributors of this document shall not be liable for any damages, losses, injury, costs or expenses, direct,
indirect or incidental, consequential or special, arising out of, or related to the use of information within
this document, or any material it references."

A TRM may substitute its content section for some other media (video, web-based article, book, etc.),
including sub-sets of other media such as a timestamp of a video or pages of a book so long as:
- The author credits the original content author if known.
- The author links to the webpage source if available.
- The author cites the content using APA style.
- The authors make a copy of the referenced media available to other team members.
- The TRM includes the SHA-256 hash of the reverenced material.

Auditors of TRMs shall - at minimum - do the following:
- Remove outdated or incorrect information.
- Check for and remove previously unknown safety hazards.
- Ensure the materials don't reinforce poor safety practices.
- Update references to external documents or media.
- Eliminate conflicting information.
- Find instructions and information to improve.

== Policy document audits
All departments shall audit their TRM and SDR documents no less than once per year to ensure correctness, safety, compliance with any formatting standards, and compliance with revision control standards.

One member per department shall audit organizational standards no less than once per year to ensure correctness, safety, compliance with any formatting standards, and compliance with revision control standards.
All team members must approve any changes to organizational standards.

== Policy document Job Safety Analysis
All SDR or TRM processes requiring use of tools, handling objects that may cause injury if dropped, use of chemicals, or require PPE shall include a JSA for the relevant processes. The Safety Dept. may also order the addition of a JSA to a SDR or TRM as they see fit.
